# Changelog

All notable changes to symcrys are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) as described in `CLAUDE.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes): `pointGroups`, `pointGroup`,
  `POINT_GROUP_KEYS`, `isPointGroupKey`, `findPointGroup`; their settings (`settings`), operations
  and generators as Cartesian matrices (`operations`, `generators`), and short, full and
  Schoenflies symbols (`symbol`), each in the ITC convention (default) or the Birss convention.
- Properties that follow from the operations: `isCentrosymmetric`, `isPolar`, `isChiral`,
  `laueClass`.
- `latticeBasis` and `crystalFamily`: the conventional lattice basis in the Cartesian frame
  (hexagonal family: x ∥ a, z ∥ c).
- `docs/conventions.md`: frames, settings, symbols and the differences between ITC and Birss.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-08

### Changed

- npm: 0.1.0 was published by hand; from this version on, each release is staged on npm by the
  release workflow (trusted publishing) and goes live after approval by the maintainer.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- Project scaffold: TypeScript build to `dist/` (ES modules with type declarations), tests, lint,
  format check, CI and release workflow. The only export so far is `VERSION`.
